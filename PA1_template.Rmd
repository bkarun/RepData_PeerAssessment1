This is an R Markdown document produced for the submission os Peer Assignment #1 for the Coursera course "Reproducible Research". The code chunks for each of the steps mentioned are given below in order


###Loading and preprocessing the data
 
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
#Use dplyr for efficiency
library(dplyr)
act_df <- tbl_df(activity)
#Convert date to a Date field
act_df <- mutate(act_df, Date = as.Date(date))
act_df <- select(act_df, - date)
```

###What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
act_by_day <- group_by(act_df, Date)
sum_by_day <- summarise(act_by_day, daily_steps = sum(steps))
library(datasets)
hist(sum_by_day$daily_steps, main = "Histogram of total daily steps",
         col = "red", xlab = "Total daily steps", ylab = "Frequency")
```
 
2. Mean and Median total number of steps taken per day 
```{r}
mean_daily_steps <- format(mean(sum_by_day$daily_steps, na.rm = T), scientific = F)
median_daily_steps <- median(sum_by_day$daily_steps, na.rm = T)
```

The Mean daily steps is `r mean_daily_steps`
The Median daily steps is `r median_daily_steps`

### What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Time series plot with average number of steps across days:
```{r}
act_by_intrvl <- group_by(act_df, interval)
avg_by_intrvl <- summarise(act_by_intrvl, avg_intrvl = mean(steps, na.rm = T))
plot(avg_by_intrvl$interval, avg_by_intrvl$avg_intrvl, type = 'l',ylab = "Average steps by interval", xlab = "Intervals", main = "Time series plot of average steps by interval across days")
```
2. The 5 minute interval with the maximum average number of steps:
```{r}
max_avg <- filter(avg_by_intrvl, avg_intrvl == max(avg_intrvl))
```
The maximum average steps taken for an interval across days is `r round(max_avg$avg_intrvl)` steps for the interval `r max_avg$interval`

###Imputing missing values

1. The total number of missing values in the data set is `r nrow(act_df[!complete.cases(act_df),])`

2. The 'NA' values in step are replaced by the mean steps for the interval across days

3. New data set with replaced values for NA is created. Steps 2 & 3 is accomplished in the following 
   chunk of code
```{r}
#Merge with the dataset having average steps by interval
act_df_new <- merge(act_df, avg_by_intrvl, by = "interval")
#replace the steps with NA values with the average value
act_df_new <- act_df_new%>%mutate(steps = ifelse (is.na(steps), round(avg_intrvl), steps))
#drop the column with the averages
act_df_new <- select(act_df_new, -avg_intrvl)
```

4. Histogram with the number of steps taken each day:
```{r}
#Grouping by day
act_by_day_new <- group_by(act_df_new, Date)
#Summarize by day 
sum_by_day_new <- summarise(act_by_day_new, daily_steps = sum(steps))
#Plot histogram
hist(sum_by_day_new$daily_steps, main = "Histogram of total daily steps after imputation",
         col = "red", xlab = "Total daily steps", ylab = "Frequency")
#Calculate the mean and median
mean_new <- format(mean(sum_by_day_new$daily_steps, na.rm = T), scientific = F)
median_new <- format(median(sum_by_day_new$daily_steps, na.rm = T), scientific = F)
```

The mean and median has increased after imputation
The Estimate for the the total number of steps daily has also increased after imputation

###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1.The chunk of code below, creates a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
#create a factor variable wk_day that separates weekdays and weekends
act_df_week <- act_df_new%>%mutate(wk_day = ifelse (weekdays(Date) %in% c("Sunday", "Saturday"), "Weekend", "Weekday"))
```
 
2. Panel plot with Time series plot of 5 mins interval  
```{r}
act_df_wkdy <- filter(act_df_week, wk_day == "Weekday")
act_by_intrvl_wkday <- group_by(act_df_wkdy, interval)
avg_by_intrvl_wkday <- summarise(act_by_intrvl_wkday, avg_intrvl = mean(steps, na.rm = T))

act_df_wknd <- filter(act_df_week, wk_day == "Weekend")
act_by_intrvl_wknd <- group_by(act_df_wknd, interval)
avg_by_intrvl_wknd <- summarise(act_by_intrvl_wknd, avg_intrvl = mean(steps, na.rm = T))

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(avg_by_intrvl_wkday$interval, avg_by_intrvl_wkday$avg_intrvl, type = 'l',main = "Time series plot of average steps by interval across week days",
         col = "red", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average steps by interval")
plot(avg_by_intrvl_wknd$interval, avg_by_intrvl_wknd$avg_intrvl, type = 'l', main = "Time series plot of average steps by interval across weekends",
         col = "red", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average steps by interval")
```
